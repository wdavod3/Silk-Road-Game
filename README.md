# Silk-Road-Game
# This is a copy of the code used for a game based on the Silk Road used for CS 440 at UIC. This was a group project done in collaboration with: Christopher Khoshaba, Christian Ramirez Gomez, and Joel Koreth. The portion of the game I worked on was the opening screens for the player to sign in, as well as portions of the game play screen. This is a game based on moving throughout a map trading recourses for money and vice versa. As the game goes on there are some random events that will occur.
